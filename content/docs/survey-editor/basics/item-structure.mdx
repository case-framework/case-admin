- **Separates content into different pages.**
- Improves readability and controls how questions are grouped.
- Respondents will need to click “Next” to proceed to the next page.

**Response Group**
- **Groups multiple question items together.**
- Useful for displaying several related questions under a shared heading or context.
- Helps organize questions logically within a single section.

**Info Item**
- **Displays additional information without asking for input.**
- Can include text instructions, explanations, or visual content.
- Supports the respondent with guidance or context before a question or section.

**End of Survey Content**
- **Marks the end of the survey flow.**
- Can display a closing message, thank-you note, or redirect.
- Typically includes logic to stop collecting further responses.
