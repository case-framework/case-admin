#### **Body**
Main content that surrounds the response options:
- **Top content (before response)** – Text shown above the answer options.
- **Response options** – Here you define the response options. The type of question determines the available response configurations.
- **Bottom content (after response)** – Text shown after answer options.

#### **Footnote**

## Other Item Types in a Survey

Besides question items, a survey can contain several non-question (structural or informational) items. These help organize and enrich the flow and content of the survey.

### • Page Break
- **Separates content into different pages.**
- Improves readability and controls how questions are grouped.
- Respondents will need to click “Next” to proceed to the next page.

### • Response Group
- **Groups multiple question items together.**
- Useful for displaying several related questions under a shared heading or context.
- Helps organize questions logically within a single section.

### • Info Item
- **Displays additional information without asking for input.**
- Can include text instructions, explanations, or visual content.
- Supports the respondent with guidance or context before a question or section.

### • End of Survey Content
- **Marks the end of the survey flow.**
- Can display a closing message, thank-you note, or redirect.
- Typically includes logic to stop collecting further responses.
