# Conditions
### Tutorial: Understanding Conditional Logic Expressions in Surveys

Expressions are used to define **conditional logic** for displaying survey items. This means that a specific item or group of items will only be shown to a particpant if certain conditions related to their previous answers or to the properties of the participant are met. 

**Context:** The goal of these conditions is to determine if a specific survey item (and its children for groups) should be **displayed** or **hidden** based on previous responses or participants characteristics. The item will *only* be displayed if the defined condition evaluates to `true`.

### Logical Operators

These operators allow you to combine two or more individual conditions to form a single, more complex condition.

#### 1. "`&& and` (AND operator)"
    * **Meaning:** This operator requires *all* the conditions it connects to be `true` for the overall combined condition to be `true`. If even one of the connected conditions is `false`, the entire `and` condition becomes `false`.
    * **Use Case:** To display a question only when *multiple specific criteria* are met from different parts of the survey.
        * **Example:** Display the question 'Please describe the onset and progression of the rash' **if** (patient selected 'Yes' to 'Have you experienced fever in the last 24 hours?') **AND** (patient selected 'Yes' to 'Do you have a new skin rash?')
    * **How it works:** Wrap two or more individual conditions with an `and` operator.

#### 2. "|| or (OR operator)"
    * **Meaning:** This operator requires *at least one* of the conditions it connects to be `true` for the overall combined condition to be `true`. The entire `or` condition is only `false` if *all* of the connected conditions are `false`.
    * **Use Case:** To display a question if any of several possible situations applies.
        * **Example:** Display the alert 'Requires urgent physician review' **if** (patient's 'Heart Rate' > 100 bpm) OR (patient's 'Systolic Blood Pressure' `< 90 mmHg') **OR** (patient reports 'Severe Chest Pain').
    * **How it works:** Wrap two or more individual conditions with an `or` operator.

#### 3. "not (NOT operator)"
    * **Meaning:** This operator inverts the truth value of a single condition. If the original condition is `true`, `not` makes it `false`. If the original condition is `false`, `not` makes it `true`.
    * **Use Case:** To display a question when a specific criterion is *not* met, or when a user *didn't* select a particular option.
        * **Example:** Display question 'Please specify your allergies or sensitivities to common medications' **if** (`not` (patient selected 'No known allergies' to 'Do you have any known allergies?')). This means if the patient selected anything other than 'No known allergies'.
    * **How it works:** Apply the `not` operator directly to another condition.

### Comparison Operators

These operators are used to compare the value of a respondent's answer (Left side, `L`) against a specific target value or another answer (Right side, `R`). They are primarily used for numerical, date, or sometimes alphabetical string comparisons.

#### 1. "Equals (L `==` R)"
    * **Meaning:** Checks if the value on the left side (`L`) is exactly equal to the value on the right side (`R`).
    * **Use Case:** To display a question if a numerical input matches a precise value.
        * **Example:** Display 'Initiate emergency protocol for hypoglycemia' if (patient's `'Blood Glucose Level' == 70 mg/dL`). (Assuming 70 is a critical threshold).
    * **How it works:** Select item key and response slot key of the answer (for `L`) and then provide a specific value or another question's answer (for `R`).

---

#### 2. "Less than or equal (L `<=` R)"
    * **Meaning:** Checks if the value on the left side (`L`) is less than or equal to the value on the right side (`R`).
    * **Use Case:** To group respondents numerical thresholds (e.g. age ranges).
        * **Example:** Display question 'Is the child's vaccination record up to date?' **if** (patient's 'Age' `<= 12 years`)
    * **How it works:** Select item key and response slot key of the answer (for `L`) and then provide a specific value or another question's answer (for `R`).

---

#### 3. "Less than (L < R)"
    * **Meaning:** Checks if the value on the left side (`L`) is strictly less than the value on the right side (`R`).
    * **Use Case:** Similar to "less than or equal," but excludes the threshold value itself.
        * **Example:** Display recommendation 'Consider iron supplementation' **if** (patient's 'Hemoglobin Level' < 12.0 g/dL).
    * **How it works:** Select item key and response slot key of the answer (for `L`) and then provide a specific value or another question's answer (for `R`).

---

#### 4. "Greater than or equal (L `>=` R)"
    * **Meaning:** Checks if the value on the left side (`L`) is greater than or equal to the value on the right side (`R`).
    * **Use Case:** To filter respondents based on minimum requirements or thresholds.
        * **Example:** Display warning 'Requires immediate physician review for hypertension' **if** (patient's 'Systolic Blood Pressure' `>= 160 mmHg`).
    * **How it works:** Select item key and response slot key of the answer (for `L`) and then provide a specific value or another question's answer (for `R`).

---

#### 5. "Greater than (L > R)"
    * **Meaning:** Checks if the value on the left side (`L`) is strictly greater than the value on the right side (`R`).
    * **Use Case:** Similar to "greater than or equal," but excludes the threshold value itself.
        * **Example:** Display recommendation 'Consider weight management program' **if** (patient's 'BMI' > 25.0).
    * **How it works:** Select item key and response slot key of the answer (for `L`) and then provide a specific value or another question's answer (for `R`).

### Response dependencies

#### 1. "A specific response is present"

* **Meaning:** This condition evaluates to true if a respondent has selected a specific option or provided an input of a particular previous question:
    - For Radio Button/Dropdown Questions: the participant has selected the specified option.
    - For Entry Fields (text, numerical, date, etc.): the participant has entered any characters or data into the field, meaning the field is not empty. The content of the answer is not relevant. This also applies to the subsequent conditions.
* **Use Case:** You might use this if you want to show a follow-up question only if the user has selected a specific option of a preceding question.
    * **Example:** Display 'Please describe the location and intensity of your pain (on a scale of 1-10):' only if the patient selected 'Yes' in the question 'Are you currently experiencing any pain?'.
* **How it works:** Select a previous question item key and specify the option key.

---

#### 2. "Response contains any of these keys"

* **Meaning:** This condition checks if the response to a specific previous question includes *at least one* of a predefined set of options keys. This is particularly useful for multiple-choice questions where a user can select several options.
* **Use Case:** To display a follow-up question based on one or more specific choices made by the respondent.
    * **Example:** Display the question 'Please describe the frequency and severity of your attacks' if the patient selected 'Epilepsy' OR 'Migraine' OR 'Multiple Sclerosis' (or a combination thereof) in response to the question 'Which chronic conditions do you have?'
* **How it works:** Select a previous question item key, select slot keys if necessary and then specify a list of option keys. The condition evaluates to `true` if the respondent's answer for that question matches *any* of the specified keys.

---

#### 3. "Response contains all of these keys"

* **Meaning:** This condition is stricter than "any of these keys." It checks if the response to a specific previous question includes *all* of a predefined set of option keys. Again, this is typically for multiple-choice questions where multiple selections are possible.
* **Use Case:** To display a question only when a respondent has selected a very specific combination of options.
    * **Example:** Display the info text 'Please schedule an urgent consultation with the Nephrology department and Cardiology department' if the participant, in response to the question 'Which of the following chronic conditions do you have? (Select all that apply)', selected both 'Chronic Kidney Disease' AND 'Congestive Heart Failure'.
* **How it works:** Select a previous question item key, select slot keys if necessary and then specify a list of option keys. The condition evaluates to `true` only if the respondent's answer for that question matches *every single one* of the specified keys.

---

#### 4. "Has response but none of these keys:"

* **Meaning:** This condition checks if a respondent has provided an answer to a specific previous question, but that answer *does not* match any of a predefined set of option keys.
* **Use Case:** To display a question when the respondent has answered a question, but *not* with certain pre-identified responses. 
    * **Example:** Show question 'Please specify your other dietary restrictions:' if the respondent answered 'Dietary Restrictions' in 'Do you have any dietary needs?' but did *not* select 'Vegetarian' or 'Vegan'.
* **How it works:** Select a previous question item key, select slot keys if necessary and then specify a list of option keys. The condition evaluates to `true` if the question has a response *and* that response does not match any of the specified keys.

---

#### 5. "Check response value with regex"

* **Meaning:** This is a flexible condition that allows you to validate or check a respondent's text input against a Regular Expression (RegEx). RegEx is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.
* **Use Case:** This is ideal for open-text fields where you need to check the *format* or *pattern* of the input, rather than specific values.
    * **Example 1 (Email):** "Show question 'We will send a confirmation email' if the respondent's 'Email Address' response matches a valid email format (e.g., `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`)."
    * **Example 2 (Phone Number):** "Show question 'Please confirm your availability' if the 'Phone Number' response matches a standard phone number pattern."
* **How it works:** You select a previous question item key with text, date or number input or a participant flag value and then provide a regular expression. The condition evaluates to `true` if the respondent's answer (converted to string) matches the defined RegEx pattern.

TODO
#### 6. "Is survey item validation true"

* **Meaning:** This condition checks if the built-in validation rules for a specific previous survey item have been met. Many survey platforms allow you to set validation rules (e.g., "must be a number," "must be greater than 10," "must be a valid date"). This expression checks the outcome of that validation.
* **Use Case:** To ensure data quality or to guide the user if they entered invalid information.
    * **Example:** "Show question 'Thank you for your valid input' if the 'Age' question's validation (e.g., 'must be between 18 and 100') is true."
    * **Example:** "Show question 'Please review your input as it appears to be incorrect' if the 'Postal Code' question's validation is *not* true." (You'd likely invert this condition or use a different flow for errors).
* **How it works:** You select a previous question that has validation rules applied to it. The condition evaluates to `true` if the respondent's input for that question passes all its defined validation rules.
TODO: validation key.
